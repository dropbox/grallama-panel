# Grafana GraLLAMA Panel

<img src="src/img/grallama-logo-large.png" align="right" width="100px">

GraLLAMA is a panel plugin for Grafana which visualizes the matrix-like data
collected by the [LLAMA](https://github.com/dropbox/llama) project. See the
LLAMA project on GitHub for more information:
    
https://github.com/dropbox/llama

## Features
* Displays loss percentages between sources and destinations.
* Sources/Destinations are dynamically pulled from timeseries tags.
* Changes cell color based on higher percentages.

## Compatibility
This panel should work with the following datasources:
[InfluxDB](https://grafana.net/plugins/influxdb)

## Caveats
1. Colors are hard-coded currently; ranges from **green**(0%) to **red**(10%)
2. Panel setup is non-intuitive and strict (see Setup section below)
3. No dynamic functionality or graphs

## Installation
Use the new grafana-cli tool to install grallama-panel from the commandline:

```
grafana-cli plugins install dropbox-grallama-panel
```

The plugin will be installed into your grafana plugins directory; the default
is /var/lib/grafana/plugins if you installed the grafana package.

More instructions on the cli tool can be found
[here](http://docs.grafana.org/v3.0/plugins/installation/).

You need the lastest grafana build for Grafana 3.0 to enable plugin support.
You can get it here : http://grafana.org/download/builds.html

## Setup
After installing the panel plugin follow these instructions to visualize
the latest loss data from your running LLAMA deployment.

0. Setup a datasource for InfluxDB where LLAMA data is stored.
1. Add a new panel to a row in Grafana and select GraLLAMA.
2. Open the query editor and select InfluxDB and the measurement `loss`.
3. Select `mean()` as an aggregation (or others if you see fit).
4. Select `Group by` using exactly two tags; one of them will be the source
tag and the other will be the destination tag. Also, use `fill(null)`.
5. Type into the `Alias by` field `<source_tag>-<dest_tag>` (the hypen is
important). If your source tag was `foo` and destination tag was `bar` then
the field would look like this:  `$tag_foo-$tag_bar`
